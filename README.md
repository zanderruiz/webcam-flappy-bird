# Webcam-Based Flappy Bird Game

This project is a creative take on the popular game "Flappy Bird," designed to be played using a webcam to track a specific object's movement. It explores the concept of using computer vision to interact with a game, simulating the kind of tracking software employed by video applications like Snapchat and Instagram.

## Overview

Flappy Bird is a classic mobile game where the player controls a bird that must navigate through a series of pipes by tapping the screen to make the bird flap its wings. The objective is to pass through as many pipes as possible without colliding with them.

In this version of Flappy Bird, we replace the traditional touch or keyboard controls with webcam-based tracking. The player's movement is tracked through the webcam, making the game interactive and engaging in a novel way.

## Features

- **Webcam Integration:** The game uses your webcam to track a specific object, allowing you to control the flappy bird's movement on the screen.

- **Computer Vision:** It employs computer vision techniques to identify and track the object, simulating the kind of real-time tracking used in popular social media applications.

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Navigate the flappy bird through pipes by moving the tracked object up and down.

- **Score Tracking:** The game keeps track of your score, counting how many pipes you successfully pass through.

## Getting Started

1. **Setup:**
   - Make sure you have Processing installed on your computer.
   - Connect a webcam to your computer.

2. **Run the Game:**
   - Open the Processing sketch file (`webcam_flappy_bird.pde`) in Processing.
   - Click the "Run" button in the Processing IDE to start the game.

3. **Gameplay:**
   - Hold up a distinctive object (e.g., a red-colored object) in front of your webcam.
   - Move the object up and down to control the flappy bird's flight.

4. **Scoring:**
   - The score increases each time you successfully pass through a pipe.
   - Try to achieve the highest score possible!

## Customization

Feel free to customize the game by modifying the images, pipe locations, or even the tracking logic to experiment with different gameplay experiences.
